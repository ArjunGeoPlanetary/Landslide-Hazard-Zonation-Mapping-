# Landslide-Hazard-Zonation-Mapping-
Technical implementation of Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) mapping based on IS 14496-2:1998 standards. Demonstrates expertise in the LHEF (Landslide Hazard Evaluation Factor) rating system, multi-thematic layer integration, and macro-zonation for mountainous terrains.

# Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) Macro-Zonation Methodology

## Project Overview
This repository outlines the standardized methodology for Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) mapping in mountainous terrains, strictly following the guidelines of **Indian Standard IS 14496-2:1998**. This approach uses the **Landslide Hazard Evaluation Factor (LHEF)** rating system to provide a quantitative basis for hazard assessment.

## The LHEF Rating System
The methodology involves assigning numerical values to major causative factors based on their relative contribution to slope instability. I have experience integrating the following 6 thematic layers:

1. **Lithology:** Evaluation of rock type, weathering grade, and susceptibility to failure.
2. **Structure:** Analysis of joints, faults, and bedding planes (Fold/Fault relationship).
3. **Slope Morphometry:** Categorization based on slope steepness and relief.
4. **Relative Relief:** Assessment of local altitude variations within the terrain.
5. **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC):** Evaluating the protective role of vegetation vs. anthropogenic pressure.
6. **Hydrogeological Conditions:** Assessing groundwater flow, seepage, and surface drainage.

## Technical Workflow
1. **Facet Preparation:** Dividing the terrain into "Slope Facets" (the basic mapping unit per IS code).
2. **Data Collection:** Integrating remote sensing data (IRS/LISS-IV, Sentinel) with field-verified geological data.
3. **Total Estimated Hazard (TEHD):** Calculating the final hazard index by summing the LHEF ratings for each facet.
4. **Zonation:** Classification into five zones:
    * Very Low Hazard (VLH)
    * Low Hazard (LH)
    * Moderate Hazard (MH)
    * High Hazard (HH)
    * Very High Hazard (VHH)

## Tools & Compliance
* **Software:** ArcGIS Pro /ArcMap .
* **Standard:** IS 14496 (Part 2): 1998.
* **Application:** Infrastructure planning, hydropower project siting, and disaster mitigation for Himalayan and Western Ghats regions.
